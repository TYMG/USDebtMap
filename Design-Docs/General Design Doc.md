From 1999 to 2016 there is data on the different types of Debt. This MEAN Stack project will use D3.js to display that data in a visually appealing fashion,using a map of the United States and a table. And the site should be responsive in order to accomodate mobile phones and tablets alike.

# Pages
This project should have about 2-3 pages. The Main Page, How it works, and maybe an About Us Page. 

So the main page will consist of a couple elements, a header, the Animated US Map, the Animated Table, and a footer. 

The How it Works can just be a technical explanation or two of how some of the cooler things were done.

## Main Page
### Header
Simple Header that will contain the links to the other pages. The header should be a fixed to the top of the page.

### Animated US Map
![Shit Tier Wireframe](Wireframes/Photos/US_State_Debt_Map.jpg "Basic Wireframe")
The Animated US Map is one of the mediums that will be used to show the user the State Debt Data (SDD). Each State will be represented on the Map.
Each State will be color coded depending on amount of debt that state has. The Heat Index (HI) will indicate to the user what color means what. The HI will reside to the right of the map. Below the HI will be the year. Slider?


#### The Animation

From 1999 to 2016 there is data on the different types of Debt. The site will show that data on the map using the colors which 
will change as the years go up or down. The color transitions should relatively smooth from year to year. The year should be animated as well, such as a scroll up down.


### Animated Table 
![Shit Tier Wireframe](Wireframes/Photos/Animated_Table.jpg "Basic Wireframe")
The Animated table is the second medium that will be used to show the user the SDD. The Table will have the States as the rows and the Years as the columns. There will be a drop down that has the different types of debt and the population. Depending on what is selected in the drop down, the table will display that data. 

#### The Animation
To help the user read the data easier, table will color code the data in different ways. 
* Highlights By Year Using Timed Intervals
  * Color Coating much like the states
  * Plain Yellow
* Show and Hide States 
  * Fade States In And Out as need to help user focus.
  * Fuzzy Hide

### Footer
It will contain the Bibliographic citation of the source we pulled this data from.
